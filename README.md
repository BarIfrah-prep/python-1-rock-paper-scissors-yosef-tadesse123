# Rock Paper Scissors!
# Hi and welcome to your first assignment!
Here, your goal is to create a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, with all the knowledge youv'e got so far.\
This is the **README** file. a **README** file is a text, or as you can see here, an "MD" file,\
where all of your program information (how to run, what is the input/output, and everything you think is nessecary for the understanding of your code).\
I'll give you a template this time, but from here on you'll need to manage this by yourselves. Good luck!

# (rock paper scissors) 
first im put import random is must for the randint function to work
and define variables and lists and im going to use the latter
and iam wrote a game rules to explain to the player the rules

im define while true loop because im want to the code run with no end
after that im put variable type input int so the player enter his choice 
and then im wrote condition  if the player not enter the right chose
and then im wrote a code for computer to choose number 0 until to 2 
and to get inside the list options and to print the computer choice as a string

and then im wrote all the win tie and lose conditions and im put a counter to count the score
after the condition im ask the player if he want to play again
 end im wrote a while loop if the player do not enter yes or no 
the im ask him please wrote yes or no and then because the while loop im ask him 
if he want to play again 
and then i player enter no i tell him the score of the game and tell him goodbye
and if he enter yes the we going bach to the while true loop
